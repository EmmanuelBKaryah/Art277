   <h1> <strong>What is Lorem Ipsum?</strong> </h1> <br />
      <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br />
      Lorem Ipsum has been theindustry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a <br />
      galley of scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap <br />
      into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br />
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br />
     <u><strong><i>Aldus PageMaker</i></strong></u> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> 1914 translation by H. Rackham 
         <br />
          <br />
      <!--Reason for the add multiple paragraphy: Split -Screen-->
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore  <br />
      et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi <br />
      ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse <br />
      cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa <br />

      <h1><strong>Why do we use it?</strong> </h1>
      <br>
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its <br>
      layout. The point of using<u>Lorem Ipsum</u>is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br />
      using “Content here, content here”, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br />
      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem Ipsum” will uncover <br />
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br />
      sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). 
         <br />
         <br />
      <h1><strong>Where can I get some?</strong></h1>
      <br>
      <br />
      <strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered<br />
      alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly <br />
      believable.</strong> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <br />
      embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<i>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat <br />
      predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over <br />
      200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks  <br />
      reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non<br />
      characteristic words etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Instructions</strong><br />
